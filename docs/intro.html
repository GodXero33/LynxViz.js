<h1>LynxViz.js</h1>
<div class="p-type1">
	<p>Welcome to LynxViz.js! This library is here to help you create amazing animations for your website. With it, you can easily set up an animation loop using JavaScript and animate anything you want. LynxViz.js also includes additional mathematical functions that aren't available in the default JS Math library, along with some geometry-related functions that can be really helpful when working with simulations. There's a lot more in store, and you'll discover everything through this documentation.</p>

<h2>Why use this library?</h2>
<div class="p-type1">
	<p>I originally created this library to make things easier for myself. But I soon realized there are many developers out there who end up writing the same code over and over again when animating something. So why not make life simpler by using a library? The problem is, most animation libraries out there are packed with extra features that can make your web page heavier. LynxViz.js is different, it's a lightweight library that focuses purely on animations.</p>
	<br>
	<p>As I said, the main purpose behind this library was to make things easier for me, but it can help others too. That said, if you're just looking to create a simple animation, there's no need to use a fancy library (unless your animation is super complex). You can use LynxViz.js or even write your own code. But remember, working with libraries (including this one) can sometimes make debugging a bit harder, and there will be bugs along the way.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Also, keep in mind that this library won't magically help you come up with better animation ideas. That's all in your hands! LynxViz.js is just here to support you with the animation loop. So, make sure to plan your animations well, okay?</p>
